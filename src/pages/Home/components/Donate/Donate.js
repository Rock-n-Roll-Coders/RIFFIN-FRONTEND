        Riffin was created with one goal in mind: 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Jot down musical ideas without friction from the medium. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Part of that commitment is keeping Riffin free.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        $5 is enough to cover the cost of storing and accessing a frequent user's data for one year. If you're enjoying Riffin, please consider "buying me a coffee".
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Be excellent to each other, and party on dudes! ðŸ¤˜
